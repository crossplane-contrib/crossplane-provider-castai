                                  Cron expression defining when the schedule should trigger.


                                  The `cron` expression can optionally include the `CRON_TZ` variable at the beginning to specify the timezone in which the schedule should be interpreted.


                                  Example:
                                  ```plaintext
                                  CRON_TZ=America/New_York 0 12 * * ?
                                  ```
                                  In the example above, the `CRON_TZ` variable is set to "America/New_York" indicating that the cron expression should be interpreted in the Eastern Time (ET) timezone.


                                  To retrieve a list of available timezone values, you can use the following API endpoint:


                                  GET https://api.cast.ai/v1/time-zones


                                  When using the `CRON_TZ` variable, ensure that the specified timezone is valid and supported by checking the list of available timezones from the API endpoint.  If the `CRON_TZ` variable is not specified, the cron expression will be interpreted in the UTC timezone.

                                  The `cron` expression can optionally include the `CRON_TZ` variable at the beginning to specify the timezone in which the schedule should be interpreted.


                                  Example:
                                  ```plaintext
                                  CRON_TZ=America/New_York 0 12 * * ?
                                  ```
                                  In the example above, the `CRON_TZ` variable is set to "America/New_York" indicating that the cron expression should be interpreted in the Eastern Time (ET) timezone.


                                  To retrieve a list of available timezone values, you can use the following API endpoint:


                                  GET https://api.cast.ai/v1/time-zones


                                  When using the `CRON_TZ` variable, ensure that the specified timezone is valid and supported by checking the list of available timezones from the API endpoint.  If the `CRON_TZ` variable is not specified, the cron expression will be interpreted in the UTC timezone.

                  InitProvider holds the same fields as ForProvider, with the exception
                  of Identifier and other resource reference fields. The fields that are
                  in InitProvider are merged into ForProvider when the resource is created.
                  The same fields are also added to the terraform ignore_changes hook, to
                  avoid updating them after creation. This is useful for fields that are
                  required on creation, but we do not desire to update them after creation,
                  for example because of an external controller is managing them, like an
                  autoscaler.

                                  (String) Cron expression defining when the schedule should trigger.
                                  Cron expression defining when the schedule should trigger.


                                  The `cron` expression can optionally include the `CRON_TZ` variable at the beginning to specify the timezone in which the schedule should be interpreted.


                                  Example:
                                  ```plaintext
                                  CRON_TZ=America/New_York 0 12 * * ?
                                  ```
                                  In the example above, the `CRON_TZ` variable is set to "America/New_York" indicating that the cron expression should be interpreted in the Eastern Time (ET) timezone.


                                  To retrieve a list of available timezone values, you can use the following API endpoint:


                                  GET https://api.cast.ai/v1/time-zones


                                  When using the `CRON_TZ` variable, ensure that the specified timezone is valid and supported by checking the list of available timezones from the API endpoint.  If the `CRON_TZ` variable is not specified, the cron expression will be interpreted in the UTC timezone.

                  THIS IS A BETA FIELD. It is on by default but can be opted out
                  through a Crossplane feature flag.
                  ManagementPolicies specify the array of actions Crossplane is allowed to
                  take on the managed and external resources.
                  This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future
                  release. Currently, both could be set independently and non-default
                  values would be honored if the feature flag is enabled. If both are
                  custom, the DeletionPolicy field will be ignored.

                                  In the example above, the `CRON_TZ` variable is set to "America/New_York" indicating that the cron expression should be interpreted in the Eastern Time (ET) timezone.


                                  To retrieve a list of available timezone values, you can use the following API endpoint:


                                  GET https://api.cast.ai/v1/time-zones


                                  When using the `CRON_TZ` variable, ensure that the specified timezone is valid and supported by checking the list of available timezones from the API endpoint.  If the `CRON_TZ` variable is not specified, the cron expression will be interpreted in the UTC timezone.

                                  Cron expression defining when the schedule should trigger.


                                  The `cron` expression can optionally include the `CRON_TZ` variable at the beginning to specify the timezone in which the schedule should be interpreted.


                                  Example:
                                  ```plaintext
                                  CRON_TZ=America/New_York 0 12 * * ?
                                  ```
                                  In the example above, the `CRON_TZ` variable is set to "America/New_York" indicating that the cron expression should be interpreted in the Eastern Time (ET) timezone.


                                  To retrieve a list of available timezone values, you can use the following API endpoint:


                                  GET https://api.cast.ai/v1/time-zones


                                  When using the `CRON_TZ` variable, ensure that the specified timezone is valid and supported by checking the list of available timezones from the API endpoint.  If the `CRON_TZ` variable is not specified, the cron expression will be interpreted in the UTC timezone.
