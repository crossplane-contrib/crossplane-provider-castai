                            expression should be interpreted in the Eastern Time (ET)
                            timezone. \n To retrieve a list of available timezone
                            values, you can use the following API endpoint: \n GET
                            https://api.cast.ai/v1/time-zones \n When using the `CRON_TZ`
                            variable, ensure that the specified timezone is valid
                            and supported by checking the list of available timezones
                            from the API endpoint.  If the `CRON_TZ` variable is not
                            specified, the cron expression will be interpreted in
                            the UTC timezone."
