                            The `cron` expression can optionally include the `CRON_TZ` variable at the beginning to specify the timezone in which the schedule should be interpreted.


                            Example:
                            ```plaintext
                            CRON_TZ=America/New_York 0 12 * * ?

                            In the example above, the `CRON_TZ` variable is set to "America/New_York" indicating that the cron expression should be interpreted in the Eastern Time (ET) timezone.


                            To retrieve a list of available timezone values, you can use the following API endpoint:


                            GET https://api.cast.ai/v1/time-zones


                            When using the `CRON_TZ` variable, ensure that the specified timezone is valid and supported by checking the list of available timezones from the API endpoint.  If the `CRON_TZ` variable is not specified, the cron expression will be interpreted in the UTC timezone.

                  The same fields are also added to the terraform ignore_changes hook, to

                  required on creation, but we do not desire to update them after creation,
                  for example because of an external controller is managing them, like an
                  autoscaler.

                  THIS IS A BETA FIELD. It is on by default but can be opted out
                  through a Crossplane feature flag.
                  ManagementPolicies specify the array of actions Crossplane is allowed to
                  take on the managed and external resources.
                  This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future
                  release. Currently, both could be set independently and non-default
                  values would be honored if the feature flag is enabled. If both are
                  custom, the DeletionPolicy field will be ignored.
                  See the design doc for more information: https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/499895a25d1a1a0ba1604944ef98ac7a1a71f197/design/design-doc-observe-only-resources.md?plain=1#L223

                            In the example above, the `CRON_TZ` variable is set to "America/New_York" indicating that the cron expression should be interpreted in the Eastern Time (ET) timezone.


                            To retrieve a list of available timezone values, you can use the following API endpoint:


                            GET https://api.cast.ai/v1/time-zones


                            When using the `CRON_TZ` variable, ensure that the specified timezone is valid and supported by checking the list of available timezones from the API endpoint.  If the `CRON_TZ` variable is not specified, the cron expression will be interpreted in the UTC timezone.
